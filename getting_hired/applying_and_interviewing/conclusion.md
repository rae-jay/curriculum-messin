### AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

I hope you're reading this from an actual dumpster.  If you got a job after slaying the beasts of the Underworld, [let us know!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)  We'd love to hear how everything went, and we have a Discord channel where anyone can share their success stories.  

I hecked up and followed too many steps in the wrong direction, whoopie. Changing text. Apples.

Before you move on from the course, we would like your feedback [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenziSaFuSQ3RFeHwn1YHovQj-G-WmNZc-_dgMuV_JcGB25Cg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Getting user(you) feedback is important so we can continue to improve the curriculum and get an idea of your experience.  

So build some kick ass software, learn as much as you can, and pay it forward when you're able.  **Thanks for participating in the project!!!**
